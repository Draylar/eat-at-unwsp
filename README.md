# eat@unwsp

eat@unwsp is a simple and intuitive caf√© menu site for students at UNWSP. It is built with NodeJS for the backend and your standard suite on the front-end. 

Students can use the tool to easily see the menu for each day, or view the menu for days in the future/past. The backend also exposes several API calls for other applications to work with, if needed.
